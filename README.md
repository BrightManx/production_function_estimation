# Production Function Estimation (Panel Data Analysis)
This captivating assignment, undertaken as a the second group work during my econometrics course, aimed at estimating the production function of a firm, using robust statistical techniques.  
We applied the main Panel Data Analysis tools and models, such as the Fixed Effect (FE) and Random Effect (RE) to identifity the individual-specific and time specific latent heterogeneity and provide a statistical relevant estimation of the production function of a firm, whose data was provided by the professor.
